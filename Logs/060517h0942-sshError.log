Global variable on ssh agent was unset after
uninstall "cheese". The daemon run as expected but
it is unable to connect to running tipical git 
command to syncing repos.

!! git push/pull
!! lose original mesage from shell, but it was saying something like
!! unable to connect to remote repo.

A deep search via systemctl shows a inactive(dead) service of de daemon but
clearly, it is runing. The problem was fixed by setting up the variable on
the user space, by:

!! eval $(ssh-agent)

!! set SSH_AGENT_PID=$thePidName
!! ssh-add pk-user-key
