# -J stands for Joliet filesystem type. It's a regular ISO9660
# usable on Windows machines
# -r Set permissions to any, the uid and gid are set to zero.
# -V specifies a Volume Name
# -o Output file
# -v Verbose execution
# Utf-8 has not ~ and characters like that. It is necesary to choose a 'mode'
# that this kind of character will be recognized.
# I can't undestand why UTF is not the global-world accepted/used method to code!!

genisoimage -v -J -r -V Etiqueta -o file.iso /path/from/for_iso

#Then write to disk:

xorriso -as cdrecord -v dev=/dev/sr0 -dao ms775.iso
